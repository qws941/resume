assumptions:
  - "Portfolio content changes infrequently"
  - "Traffic within free tier limits"
  - "GitHub Actions builds succeed within timeout"

edge_cases:
  - "Korean font support in PDF generation"
  - "HTML escaping in worker.js generation (backticks, $)"
  - "Cache-Control headers (3600s)"
```
