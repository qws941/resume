4. Notify FSC within 1 hour

**Phase 2: Assessment** (20 minutes)
1. Verify primary site status (unreachable/damaged)
2. Check DR site readiness (power, network, storage)
3. Verify latest backup/replication timestamp
4. Confirm data consistency

**Phase 3: Network Failover** (30 minutes)
1. Update DNS records (TTL 60 seconds)
2. BGP route announcement (DR site IPs)
3. VPN gateway failover
4. Load balancer reconfiguration
5. Verify external connectivity

**Phase 4: System Recovery** (90 minutes)
1. Power on DR servers (priority order: DB → App → Web)
2. Start critical services (matching engine, order router, market data)
3. Verify database integrity (checksum validation)
4. Enable trading API endpoints
5. Run smoke tests (place test orders)

**Phase 5: Verification** (20 minutes)
1. Functional testing (end-to-end order flow)
2. Performance testing (latency < 50ms)
3. Data integrity checks (order book reconciliation)
4. User acceptance testing (5 pilot users)
5. Go/no-go decision

**Phase 6: Go-Live** (10 minutes)
1. Enable production traffic
2. Notify users (email + website banner)
3. Monitor closely (first 2 hours)
4. Incident log updates

**Total Time**: **2.5 hours** (target 4 hours)

---

### Ransomware Recovery (Scenario 2)

**Phase 1: Isolation** (15 minutes)
1. Disconnect infected systems from network
2. Disable network shares and backups
3. Block C2 domains on firewall
4. Capture forensic evidence

**Phase 2: Assessment** (30 minutes)
1. Identify encrypted systems/files
2. Determine ransomware variant (analysis)
3. Check backup availability (not encrypted)
4. Estimate recovery time

**Phase 3: Eradication** (60 minutes)
1. Wipe infected systems (secure erase)
2. Update all systems (OS patches, AV signatures)
3. Change all credentials (passwords, keys, tokens)
4. Block known IOCs (IPs, domains, hashes)

**Phase 4: Restoration** (120 minutes)
1. Restore systems from clean backups
2. Verify backup integrity (hash validation)
3. Apply security patches before production
4. Enable monitoring/alerting

**Phase 5: Testing** (30 minutes)
1. Malware scan on restored systems
2. Functional testing
3. Monitor for re-infection (48 hours)

**Total Time**: **4 hours**

---

### Network Failover (Scenario 3)

**Automated Failover** (<15 minutes)
1. Monitor detects primary ISP down (2 consecutive failed pings)
2. BGP automatically withdraws primary routes
3. Traffic fails over to secondary ISP
4. Monitoring alert sent (no human intervention required)

**Manual Steps** (if automation fails)
1. Verify both ISPs down (rare: dual failure)
2. Activate backup 4G/5G links (100Mbps capacity)
3. Notify ISPs for troubleshooting
4. Enable traffic prioritization (critical services only)
