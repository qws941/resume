## Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Data Center Outage (Complete Facility Loss)

**Examples**:
- Fire, flood, earthquake
- Extended power outage (>12 hours)
- HVAC failure causing overheating
- Physical security breach requiring evacuation

**Impact**: Total loss of primary data center

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. Activate DR data center in Busan (automated failover for Tier 1 systems)
2. DNS cutover to DR site (TTL: 60 seconds)
3. Verify trading platform operational at DR site
4. Notify FSC and customers of DR activation
5. Estimated Total Recovery Time: **4 hours**

**Financial Impact**: ~$500K/hour downtime cost

---

### Scenario 2: Ransomware / Cyber Attack

**Examples**:
- Ransomware encryption of file servers
- Destructive malware (e.g., wiper attack)
- Compromised backups requiring restore from older backup

**Impact**: Data encryption or destruction, potentially including backups

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. Isolate affected systems (network segmentation)
2. Restore from immutable backups (air-gapped)
3. Verify backup integrity before restore
4. Rebuild systems from clean images
5. Estimated Total Recovery Time: **8-12 hours**

**Prevention**:
- Immutable backups (WORM storage)
- Air-gapped backup copy (offline tape)
- 3-2-1 backup rule (3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite)

---

### Scenario 3: Database Corruption

**Examples**:
- Software bug causing data corruption
- Storage hardware failure
- Human error (accidental deletion)

**Impact**: Data integrity compromise in production database

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. Identify corruption scope (affected tables/records)
2. Point-in-time recovery (PITR) from WAL logs
3. Validate data integrity after restore
4. Replay transactions from log files
5. Estimated Total Recovery Time: **2-6 hours**

**Prevention**:
- WAL archiving (continuous backup)
- Transaction log retention (30 days)
- Database checksum validation (daily)

---

### Scenario 4: Network Infrastructure Failure

**Examples**:
- Core switch failure
- Firewall cluster failure
- ISP outage (dual-provider)
- DDoS attack overwhelming capacity

**Impact**: Network connectivity loss, service unavailability

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. Activate redundant network paths (automatic)
2. Failover to secondary ISP (BGP reroute)
3. Enable DDoS mitigation service (scrubbing center)
4. Verify connectivity restoration
5. Estimated Total Recovery Time: **30 minutes - 2 hours**

**Prevention**:
- N+1 redundancy for all critical network components
- Dual ISP with BGP load balancing
- DDoS mitigation service on standby

---

### Scenario 5: Cloud Service Outage (AWS)

**Examples**:
- AWS region outage (Seoul)
- S3 service disruption
- Database service (RDS) failure

**Impact**: Cloud-hosted services unavailable

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. Activate multi-region deployment (Tokyo region)
2. Route traffic via Route 53 health checks
3. Verify data consistency across regions
4. Estimated Total Recovery Time: **2-4 hours**

**Prevention**:
- Multi-region deployment for critical services
- Regular cross-region replication testing
- Automated failover with Route 53

## Backup Strategy

### Backup Architecture

```
Production Systems (Seoul DC)
    ├─> Local Backups (On-site, Dell EMC Data Domain, Deduplication)
    ├─> DR Backups (Off-site, Busan DC, Dell EMC Data Domain)
    └─> Cloud Backups (AWS S3 Glacier, Immutable, 7-year retention)

Backup Schedule:
    ├─> Continuous: Database WAL logs, SIEM logs
    ├─> Hourly: VM snapshots (critical systems), firewall configs
    ├─> Daily: Full VM backups, file servers, email
    └─> Weekly: Full system images, tape archive
```

### Backup Types

#### 1. Database Backups (PostgreSQL)

**Method**: WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) Streaming + Daily Base Backups

```bash
# Continuous WAL archiving
archive_command = 'rsync -a %p barman@backup-server:/var/lib/barman/trading/incoming/%f'

# Daily base backup
barman backup trading-db --wait

# Retention policy
barman delete trading-db BEFORE 30d
```

**Recovery**:
```bash
# Point-in-time recovery (PITR)
barman recover trading-db latest /var/lib/postgresql/15/main --target-time "2025-10-16 14:30:00"

# Latest recovery
barman recover trading-db latest /var/lib/postgresql/15/main
```

#### 2. Virtual Machine Backups (Veeam)

**Schedule**:
- Tier 1 (Critical): Hourly snapshots, 24-hour retention
- Tier 2 (Important): Daily backups, 30-day retention
- Tier 3 (General): Weekly backups, 12-week retention

**Backup Job Example**:
```powershell
# Daily backup with application-aware processing
Add-VBRViJob -Name "Trading-Platform-Backup" `
  -Server "vcenter.nextrade.local" `
  -Entity "trade-match-01","trade-router-01" `
  -BackupRepository "Backup-Repository-DR" `
  -ScheduleEnabled:$true `
  -ScheduleType "Daily" `
  -ScheduleTime "02:00" `
  -RetentionPolicy "30 Days"
```

#### 3. Configuration Backups

**Automated Config Backup Script** (runs hourly):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /opt/scripts/config-backup.sh

DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/configs/$DATE"

# Firewall configs
ssh admin@fw-core-01 "execute backup config ftp config-$DATE.conf 192.168.100.10 backup password"

# Switch configs
ansible-playbook /opt/ansible/backup-switch-configs.yml

# Load balancer configs
f5-cli --host lb-01 config save /backup/$DATE/lb-config.ucs

# Git commit
cd /backup/configs && git add . && git commit -m "Auto backup $DATE" && git push
```

#### 4. Immutable Backups (Ransomware Protection)

**Implementation**:
- **WORM Storage**: Dell EMC Data Domain with retention lock (30 days)
- **Air-Gapped Tape**: LTO-9 tapes stored offsite (90 days retention)
- **Cloud Immutable**: AWS S3 Glacier with Object Lock (7 years for regulatory)

```bash
# Enable S3 Object Lock (prevents deletion/modification)
aws s3api put-object-lock-configuration --bucket nextrade-backup-immutable \
  --object-lock-configuration '{"ObjectLockEnabled":"Enabled","Rule":{"DefaultRetention":{"Mode":"GOVERNANCE","Days":90}}}'
```

**Trigger**: Primary data center completely unavailable

**Estimated Time**: 4 hours (Tier 1 systems)

**Step-by-Step**:

#### Phase 1: Assessment & Decision (30 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Verify primary site unavailability
ping -c 10 fw-core-01.seoul.nextrade.local
ssh admin@fw-core-01.seoul.nextrade.local  # Should timeout

# 2. Check DR site readiness
ssh admin@fw-core-dr-01.busan.nextrade.local
curl -f http://trade-match-dr-01:8080/health  # Expect HTTP 200

# 3. Notify incident response team
python3 /opt/scripts/send-alert.py \
  --severity "P0" \
  --message "Primary DC unavailable - Activating DR site" \
  --recipients "ciso@nextrade.com,cto@nextrade.com,ops@nextrade.com"

# 4. Get executive approval for DR activation
# (Required per policy for P0 incidents)
```

#### Phase 2: Network Cutover (1 hour)

```bash
# 1. Update DNS to point to DR site
# Primary IP: 203.0.113.10 → DR IP: 203.0.113.20
ansible-playbook /opt/ansible/dns-cutover-dr.yml

# Verify DNS propagation (TTL: 60 seconds)
dig nextrade.com @8.8.8.8  # Should return DR IP

# 2. BGP route announcement (for dedicated circuits)
ssh bgp-router-dr-01
router bgp 65001
  network 203.0.113.0 mask 255.255.255.0
  neighbor 203.0.114.1 remote-as 65002

# 3. Firewall rule activation (allow inbound traffic to DR)
ssh admin@fw-core-dr-01
config firewall policy
  edit 1
    set srcintf "wan1"
    set dstintf "dmz"
    set srcaddr "all"
    set dstaddr "trading-platform-vip"
    set action accept
    set schedule "always"
  next
end

# 4. Load balancer VIP activation
ssh root@lb-dr-01
tmsh modify ltm virtual trading-vip enabled
tmsh modify ltm pool trading-pool members add { trade-match-dr-01:8080 trade-router-dr-01:8080 }
```

#### Phase 3: Database Promotion (1.5 hours)

```bash
# 1. Promote DR database to primary (PostgreSQL)
ssh postgres@db-customer-dr-01

# Stop replication
su - postgres
psql -c "SELECT pg_wal_replay_pause();"

# Promote to primary
pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/15/main

# Verify promotion
psql -c "SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();"  # Should return 'f' (false)

# 2. Update application connection strings
ansible-playbook /opt/ansible/update-db-connection-strings.yml \
  -e "db_host=db-customer-dr-01.busan.nextrade.local"

# 3. Verify database connectivity from application servers
psql -h db-customer-dr-01 -U tradeapp -d customerdb -c "SELECT 1;"

# 4. Run database integrity checks
psql -d customerdb -c "VACUUM ANALYZE;"
psql -d customerdb -c "SELECT pg_database_size('customerdb');"
```

#### Phase 4: Application Startup (1 hour)

```bash
# 1. Start trading platform components (in order)
ssh trade-match-dr-01
systemctl start matching-engine
systemctl status matching-engine  # Verify running

ssh trade-router-dr-01

# 4. Run smoke tests
python3 /opt/tests/dr-smoke-tests.py --site dr --critical-only
```

#### Phase 5: Verification & Notification (30 minutes)

```bash
# 1. End-to-end trading test
curl -X POST https://api.nextrade.com/v1/orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"symbol":"AAPL","quantity":100,"side":"buy","type":"limit","price":150.00}'

# Expected: Order accepted, matching engine processes

# 2. Verify monitoring and logging
ssh splunk@siem-dr-01
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk search 'index=trading earliest=-5m | stats count'  # Should show recent events

# 3. Notify stakeholders

### Procedure 2: Database Restore (PITR)

**Trigger**: Database corruption or accidental deletion

**Estimated Time**: 2-6 hours (depending on database size)

**Step-by-Step**:

```bash
# 1. Stop application connections to database
ansible-playbook /opt/ansible/stop-application-tier.yml

# 2. Backup current (corrupted) database for forensics
pg_dump -h db-customer-01 -U postgres customerdb > /backup/forensics/customerdb-corrupted-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql

# 3. Identify recovery point (time before corruption)
RECOVERY_TIME="2025-10-16 14:25:00"  # 5 minutes before corruption detected

# 4. Restore base backup
barman recover trading-db 20251016T020000 /var/lib/postgresql/15/main \
  --target-time "$RECOVERY_TIME" \
  --target-action promote

# 5. Start PostgreSQL and verify
systemctl start postgresql@15-main
psql -c "SELECT current_timestamp, pg_is_in_recovery();"

# 6. Run data integrity checks
psql -d customerdb <<EOF
-- Check row counts
SELECT 'customers' AS table, COUNT(*) FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'orders' AS table, COUNT(*) FROM orders
UNION ALL
SELECT 'transactions' AS table, COUNT(*) FROM transactions;

-- Verify recent transactions (before corruption)
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE created_at > '$RECOVERY_TIME'::timestamp - interval '1 hour' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100;
EOF

# 7. Replay any missing transactions (if available)
# (From application logs or transaction queue)
python3 /opt/scripts/replay-transactions.py \
  --from "$RECOVERY_TIME" \
  --to "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')" \
  --source /var/log/trading-app/transaction-log.jsonl

# 8. Restart application tier
ansible-playbook /opt/ansible/start-application-tier.yml

# 9. Verify end-to-end functionality
python3 /opt/tests/smoke-tests.py --full-suite
```

---

### Procedure 3: VM Restore (Veeam)

**Trigger**: VM corruption, ransomware, or hardware failure

**Estimated Time**: 1-4 hours (depending on VM size)

```powershell
# 1. Identify restore point
Get-VBRBackup -Name "Trading-Platform-Backup" | Get-VBRRestorePoint | Select-Object VmName, CreationTime | Sort-Object CreationTime -Descending

# 2. Restore VM to DR host (or rebuild on primary if available)
Start-VBRRestoreVM -RestorePoint (Get-VBRRestorePoint -Name "trade-match-01" -Backup "Trading-Platform-Backup") `
  -Server "esxi-dr-01.busan.nextrade.local" `
  -Folder "Production" `
  -Reason "DR activation - primary site unavailable"

# 3. Power on restored VM
Get-VM -Name "trade-match-01" | Start-VM

# 4. Verify network connectivity and application health
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "trade-match-01" -Port 8080
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://trade-match-01:8080/health" -UseBasicParsing

# 5. If needed, restore application data from separate backup
# (Database, logs, config files)
```
