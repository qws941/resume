## 🎯 Immediate Actions Required

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets (5 minutes)

#### Required Secrets
Navigate to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/resume/settings/secrets/actions`

**Add these secrets**:

1. **`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`**
   ```bash
   # Get from: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
   # Permissions needed:
   # - Account: Cloudflare Workers Scripts (Edit)
   # - Zone: Workers Routes (Edit)
   ```

2. **`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`**
   ```bash
   # Get from: https://dash.cloudflare.com
   # Click on Workers & Pages → Overview
   # Account ID is shown on the right side
   ```

#### Optional Secrets (Recommended)

3. **`CODECOV_TOKEN`** (for coverage tracking)
   ```bash
   # Get from: https://codecov.io
   # Sign up with GitHub
   # Add repository
   # Copy token
   ```

4. **`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`** (for team notifications)
   ```bash
   # Get from: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
   # Create new webhook
   # Copy webhook URL
   ```

5. **`N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`** (for workflow automation)
   ```bash
   # Get from your n8n instance
   # Create webhook workflow
   # Copy webhook URL
   ```

---

### Step 2: Test CI Workflow (10 minutes)

#### Create Test Branch
```bash
# Create test branch
git checkout -b test/ci-workflow

# Make a small change
echo "# CI Test" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Verify CI workflow"
git push origin test/ci-workflow
```

#### Create Pull Request
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
3. Base: `develop` ← Compare: `test/ci-workflow`
4. Click "Create pull request"

#### Monitor CI Workflow
1. Go to "Actions" tab
2. Watch "CI" workflow run
3. Expected duration: ~8 minutes
4. Should see:
   - ✅ Lint
   - ✅ TypeCheck
   - ✅ Unit Tests
   - ✅ E2E Tests
   - ✅ Coverage Check
   - ✅ Build
   - ✅ Security Audit

---

### Step 3: Deploy to Production (15 minutes)

#### Merge to Main
```bash
# After CI passes
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```

#### Monitor Deploy Workflow
1. Go to "Actions" tab
2. Watch "Deploy to Cloudflare Workers" workflow
3. Expected duration: ~3 minutes
4. Should see:
   - ✅ Validate
   - ✅ Build
   - ✅ Deploy
   - ✅ Verify
   - ✅ Lighthouse
   - ✅ Notify

#### Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://YOUR_DOMAIN.workers.dev/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-12-23T..."}

# Check main page
curl https://YOUR_DOMAIN.workers.dev/

# Should return HTML with resume content
```

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### CI Workflow Results
```
✅ Lint: 0 errors, 38 warnings (non-critical)
✅ TypeCheck: Passed (with relaxed settings)
✅ Unit Tests: 274 passing
✅ E2E Tests: All passing
✅ Coverage: 93.96% (exceeds 90% threshold)
✅ Build: Successful
✅ Security Audit: No vulnerabilities
```

### Deploy Workflow Results
```
✅ Health Check: 200 OK
✅ Content Validation: Resume content present
✅ i18n: Multi-language support working
✅ Performance: Load time < 2 seconds
✅ Security Headers: CSP, HSTS, etc. present
✅ Lighthouse: Performance score > 90
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### CI Workflow Fails

#### Lint Errors
```bash
# Run locally
npm run lint

# Fix automatically
npm run lint:fix
```

#### Test Failures
```bash
# Run tests locally
npm test

# Run specific test
npm test -- tests/unit/lib/i18n.test.js

# Debug mode
npm run test:debug
```

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Run build locally
npm run build

# Debug build
npm run build:debug
```

### Deploy Workflow Fails

#### Authentication Error
```
Error: Authentication failed
```
**Solution**: Check `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` secrets

#### Deployment Error
```
Error: Failed to publish
```
**Solution**: 
1. Check Cloudflare Workers quota
2. Verify wrangler.toml configuration
3. Check worker name conflicts

#### Verification Failed
```
Error: Health check failed
```
**Solution**:
1. Check worker logs in Cloudflare dashboard
2. Verify worker is deployed
3. Check DNS settings
