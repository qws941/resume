## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

### Main Pipeline Flow (ci.yml)

```
GitHub Push Event (master/develop) or Manual Dispatch
  ↓
Stage 0: ANALYZE (detect changes)
  ├─ Outputs: portfolio_affected, job_dashboard_affected, data_affected, infra_affected
  └─ Determines which jobs to run
  ↓
Stage 1: VALIDATE & TEST (in parallel)
  ├─ lint (ESLint)
  ├─ typecheck (TypeScript)
  ├─ test-unit (Jest, 80% coverage)
  ├─ test-e2e (Playwright)
  └─ security-scan (gitleaks + npm audit)
  ↓
Stage 2: BUILD
  ├─ build-portfolio (generate worker.js from HTML)
  └─ build-job-dashboard (webpack build)
  ↓
Stage 3: DEPLOY (requires secrets)
  ├─ deploy-portfolio (to Cloudflare Workers)
  ├─ deploy-job-dashboard (to Cloudflare Workers)
  └─ Uses: CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
  ↓
Stage 4: VERIFY
  └─ verify-deployment (15+ health checks)
  ↓
Stage 5: NOTIFY (optional)
  └─ notify job (sends notifications)
```

### Scheduled Tasks (maintenance.yml)

```
Every 6 hours UTC  → auth-refresh (refresh authentication tokens)
Daily 00:00 UTC    → profile-sync (sync profile data)
Weekly Sunday 02:00 UTC → drift-detection (detect infrastructure changes)
```

### Infrastructure Management (terraform.yml)

```
Manual Dispatch Only (workflow_dispatch):
├─ plan: Preview infrastructure changes
├─ apply: Apply infrastructure changes
└─ destroy: Tear down infrastructure (safety: requires approval)
```

## 🔐 Secrets Status

### CRITICAL - Required for Deployment ⚠️

These **MUST** be configured in GitHub before deployment can proceed.

| Secret | Purpose | Where to Get | Status |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Authenticate with Cloudflare API | https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens | ❌ **NOT CONFIGURED** |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Identify Cloudflare account | https://dash.cloudflare.com/ | ❌ **NOT CONFIGURED** |

**Blocking**: Deployment jobs will **FAIL** without these secrets.

### OPTIONAL - Can Add Later

| Secret | Purpose | Used By | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` | Deployment notifications | notify job | ⏸️ Optional |
| `AUTH_SYNC_SECRET` | Job platform auth sync | maintenance.yml | ⏸️ Optional |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Session encryption | deployment | ⏸️ Optional |
| `TF_STATE_URL` | Terraform state backend | terraform.yml | ⏸️ Optional |

**Auto-Provided by GitHub**:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically available in all workflows

### Current Progress

```
Secrets Configuration:
  Critical:   0/2 configured ❌
  Optional:   0/4 configured
  ─────────────────────────
  BLOCKER:    Cannot deploy until CRITICAL secrets are set
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (30 Minutes to Live Deployment)

### Step 1: Obtain Cloudflare Credentials (5 minutes)

**Option A: Create New API Token (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. Click: "Create Token"
3. Select: "Create Custom Token"
4. Configure:
   - Name: `GitHub Actions - Resume Portfolio`
   - Permissions:
     - Account.Workers KV: Edit
     - Account.Workers Scripts: Edit
     - Zone.Workers Scripts: Edit
   - Account Resources: All accounts
5. Click: "Continue to summary"
6. Review and click: "Create Token"
7. Copy: The full token (save temporarily)

**Option B: Use Existing Global API Key**

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. Look for: "Global API Key" section
3. Click: "View" (you may need to verify your identity)
4. Copy: The API key

**Get Account ID**:

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Right sidebar: Shows "Account ID" at the top of a card
3. Copy: Account ID (32-character alphanumeric string)

**Values Needed**:
```
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN = "[Long token string starting with v1.0-]"
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID = "[32-character hex string]"
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets (10 minutes)

1. Go to: https://github.com/qws941/resume/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click: "New repository secret"
3. Configure Secret #1:
   - Name: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
   - Value: [Paste from Step 1]
   - Click: "Add secret"
4. Click: "New repository secret"
5. Configure Secret #2:
   - Name: `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
   - Value: [Account ID from Step 1]
   - Click: "Add secret"
6. Verify: Both secrets appear in the list (values masked with asterisks)

**Screenshot Checklist**:
- [ ] Secrets page loads without errors
- [ ] Both secrets visible in list
- [ ] Both secrets show masked values (asterisks)
- [ ] No error messages about invalid values

### Step 3: Trigger First Deployment (2 minutes + 5-10 minutes execution)

1. Go to: https://github.com/qws941/resume/actions
2. Left sidebar: Click "CI/CD Pipeline"
3. Click: "Run workflow" button (right side)
4. Dialog appears:
   - Branch: master (default) ✅
   - Deploy target: all (default) ✅
   - Skip tests: false (default) ✅
5. Click: "Run workflow" button
6. Wait: Workflow starts (page refreshes)

**What to Expect**:
```
Timeline:
  0:00 - Workflow starts
  0:05 - analyze job finishes, other jobs start (in parallel)
  1:30 - All validation jobs complete
  2:00 - Build jobs start
  3:00 - Build jobs complete, deploy jobs start
  5:00 - Deploy jobs complete, verify job starts
  6:00 - Verify job completes
  6:30 - Workflow complete (all jobs green)
```

### Step 4: Monitor Execution (5-10 minutes)

Watch the workflow run:

1. Click workflow run (auto-opens on trigger)
2. Watch job progress:
   - Green checkmark = Success ✅
   - Red X = Failure ❌
   - Yellow circle = Running ⏳
3. Expected sequence:
   - analyze (1 min) → all validation jobs (parallel, 2 min) → builds (2 min) → deploys (3 min) → verify (2 min)

**Logs to Monitor**:
- `analyze`: Shows which targets affected
- `lint` / `typecheck` / `test-*`: Should all pass (skip with `skip_tests` if needed)
- `build-*`: Should generate artifacts
- `deploy-*`: Should show "Successfully deployed to Cloudflare"
- `verify-*`: Should show "All 15+ checks passed"

### Step 5: Verify Services Are Live (5 minutes)

```bash
# Test Portfolio Service
curl -I https://resume.jclee.me
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

# Test Portfolio Health
curl https://resume.jclee.me/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","version":"1.0.121"}

# Test Job Dashboard Service
curl -I https://job.jclee.me
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

# Test Job Dashboard Health
curl https://job.jclee.me/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","version":"1.0.121"}

# View in browser
open https://resume.jclee.me
open https://job.jclee.me
```

**Visual Verification**:
- [ ] Portfolio loads without errors
- [ ] Portfolio pages render correctly
- [ ] Job dashboard loads
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] No 404s or 500s in console

### Step 6: Document Results (10 minutes)

Create migration completion report:

```bash
# In terminal
cat > docs/MIGRATION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md << 'EOF'
# GitHub Actions Migration - Completion Report
