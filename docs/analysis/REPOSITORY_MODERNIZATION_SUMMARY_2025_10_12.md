### 5. GitHub Workflows Optimization ✅
**Status**: Completed

**Before**:
- Workflows: 6 files (59.8K)
- Complexity: High (multiple Gemini AI workflows)
- Maintenance: High overhead

**After**:
- Workflows: 1 file (2.7K)
- Complexity: Minimal (essential deployment only)
- Maintenance: Low overhead

**Workflows Removed** (5 files, 57.1K):
- ✅ gemini-dispatch.yml (7.7K) - Workflow dispatcher
- ✅ gemini-invoke.yml (12K) - Gemini CLI invocation
- ✅ gemini-review.yml (16K) - PR review automation

- ✅ gemini-triage.yml (7.6K) - Issue labeling automation

**Workflows Kept** (1 file, 2.7K):
- ✅ deploy.yml - Essential Cloudflare Workers deployment

**Justification**:
- Removed workflows were designed for projects with active issue/PR management
- Personal resume project doesn't require automated triage/review
- Simplified CI/CD pipeline (6 → 1 workflow)

**Backup**: Created workflows-backup-2025-10-12/ in archive

**Documentation**: Created WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS_2025_10_12.md with detailed analysis

**Impact**:
- 95% reduction in workflow code
- Simplified CI/CD maintenance
- Reduced GitHub Actions minutes usage

- Wrangler 3 → 4 (test deployment carefully)

**Phase 3 - Config Migration**:
- ESLint 8 → 9 (flat config migration required)

**Phase 4 - Framework Update**:
- Jest 29 → 30 (review changelog)

**Health Check**:
- ✅ All dependencies actively used
- ✅ No dead/unused dependencies
- ✅ Clear purpose for each package
