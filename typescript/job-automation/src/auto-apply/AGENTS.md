## DEPENDENCIES

- `playwright-extra` + stealth plugin (required for anti-bot)
- Session cookies from `SessionManager`

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- **Direct playwright import**: Use `playwright-extra` with stealth
- **Skipping rate limits**: Platforms ban aggressive automation
- **Storing credentials**: Use session cookies from SessionManager
