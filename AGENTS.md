## WHERE TO LOOK

| Task                          | Location              | Notes                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Portfolio build/runtime       | `apps/portfolio/`     | `worker.js` is generated; edit source/build pipeline instead    |
| Wanted/job automation         | `apps/job-server/`    | API clients, crawlers, MCP tools, sync/auth scripts             |
| Dashboard/API workflows       | `apps/job-dashboard/` | handlers, middleware, Cloudflare workflows                      |
| Authoritative resume content  | `packages/data/`      | `resumes/master/resume_data.json` is the SSoT                   |
| Workspace commands            | `package.json`        | `automate:ssot`, `automate:full`, `build`, `test`               |
| CI/release behavior           | `.github/workflows/`  | `ci.yml`, `verify.yml`, `release.yml`, `wanted-resume-sync.yml` |
| Shared operational scripts    | `tools/scripts/`      | build, deployment, verification, sync utilities                 |
| Tests by layer                | `tests/`              | `unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/` with child guides               |
| Monitoring and n8n automation | `infrastructure/`     | dashboards, alerting, webhook workflows                         |
| Design/procedure docs         | `docs/`               | root docs guide plus ADR/architecture child guides              |

## CONVENTIONS

- npm workspaces are the day-to-day entrypoint; Bazel exists as a facade/query layer, not the primary developer workflow.
- Cloudflare Workers Builds owns production deploy authority; local deploy scripts are non-authoritative.
- `apps/portfolio/worker.js` is generated from source/build inputs; treat it as an artifact.
- Job automation code follows hexagonal boundaries: routes/tools/crawlers call shared services and clients, not each other ad hoc.
- Wanted sync automation uses `WANTED_EMAIL` + either `WANTED_COOKIES` or password fallback via `WANTED_ONEID_CLIENT_ID`.
- CI is validation-first: lint, typecheck, unit/E2E, security, Cloudflare-native validation, then release/verify.
- TypeScript strict-mode changes land in `tsconfig.json`; keep `apps/job-server/` and `packages/data/` compatible with `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` and avoid adding new unsuppressed strict violations.

## ANTI-PATTERNS (THIS PROJECT)

- Never edit generated artifacts directly (`apps/portfolio/worker.js`, derived resume outputs, generated dashboards).
- Never hardcode credentials, resume IDs, worker bindings, or Cloudflare resource IDs.
- Never use `networkidle` as a required Playwright load state for terminal-animation pages; use `domcontentloaded` or explicit waits.
- Never bypass CI/security/verification gates to make deploy or release look green.
- Never add new logic under deprecated wrappers like `apps/job-server/src/lib/`.
- Never treat docs under `analysis/` or `reports/` as normative rules; canonical rules live in AGENTS or focused guide files.

## UNIQUE STYLES

- Mixed runtime stack: Cloudflare Worker edge app, Node-based automation runtimes, and selective Python build tooling.
- Deep AGENTS hierarchy already exists in app/test/tool trees; add new child files only where a directory has distinct rules, not just many files.
- Docs split by responsibility: ADRs for durable decisions, architecture docs for system shape, guides for operational how-to, reports/analysis for historical output.
- Monitoring is split by backend role: Elasticsearch for app logs, Loki/Grafana/n8n for ops/infra workflows.

## COMMANDS

```bash
npm run automate:ssot
npm run automate:full
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:e2e
node apps/job-server/scripts/ci-resume-sync.js
```

## NOTES

- Existing child AGENTS coverage is broad in `apps/`, `tests/`, `tools/`, and parts of `infrastructure/`; avoid duplicating their scope from the root.
- `infrastructure/n8n/` and `infrastructure/monitoring/` are distinct enough to warrant child AGENTS files; `docs/` stays governed at the docs-root level in this pass.
- `bazel-*` entries at repo root can confuse file-search tools; prefer project-root relative paths and ignore build outputs when documenting source layout.
